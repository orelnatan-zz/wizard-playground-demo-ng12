        <h3>This example shows how to implement custom validations using the 'VALIDATE' event.</h3>
        
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This group obligates the user to choose only two fields by a custom validation.</li>
            <li>All fields are not required, but they have their own validations that will still take effect if any value is inserted.</li>
            <li>The third field has an IP address custom validation attached to it.</li>
            <li>The fourth field has an Israeli ID custom validation attached to it.</li>
        </ul>
